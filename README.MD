# Binary Tree (二叉树)
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two （0， 1， 2）children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. We use parent and child relationship when describing the relationship among nodes within a tree. 

## Three Criteria  
- (1). at most 2 children per node
- (2). exactly 1 root which means a single node that has no parent
- (3). exactly 1 path between root and any node
- note: we consider no nodes an empty tree (still a binary tree)

* root node - a node that has no parent.
* leaf node - a node that has no children.
